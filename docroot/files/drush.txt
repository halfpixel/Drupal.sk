SQLSTATE[HY000] [2005] Unknown MySQL server host 'localhost%3A3306%3A%2Ftmp%2Fmysql50.sock' (1)   [warning]
Drush was not able to start (bootstrap) the Drupal database.                                      [error]
Hint: This error often occurs when Drush is trying to bootstrap a site that has not been
installed or does not have a configured database.

Drush was attempting to connect to :
  Drupal version    : 6.17
  Site URI          : drupal.web.eu
  Database driver   : mysql
  Database hostname : localhost%3A3306%3A%2Ftmp%2Fmysql50.sock
  Database username : admin
  Database name     : drupal_db
  Default theme     : minnelli
  Administration theme: minnelli
  PHP configuration : /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
  Drush version     : 3.1
  Drush configuration: /data/home/user/.drush/drushrc.php
  Drupal root       : /home/user/webdir/sub/drupal
  Site path         : sites/default
  Modules path      : sites/all/modules
  Themes path       : sites/all/themes
  %paths            : Array

You can select another site with a working database setup by specifying the URI to use with the
--uri parameter on the command line or $options['uri'] in your drushrc.php file.

Command pm-releases needs a higher bootstrap level to run - you will need invoke drush from a more[error]
functional Drupal environment to run this command.
Command pm-releases needs the following modules installed/enabled to run: update.                 [error]
The drush command 'info' could not be executed.                                                   [error]
